Following things are done in backend:
1) Project architecture using clean architecture
2) Implementation of task following DDD best practice and pattern.
3) Pending: Exposing those commands for front end application in the form of APIs. 
Else we can separately test the application code. Test code is available.

Following things are done in front end:
1) Frontend application is being done using React, React Hooks , CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap.
2) Developed the application following component based architecture.
3) Created small components like Tile, Grid, Rover, Landing Headup Display, Movement Heads Up Display. 
All these components are used by main app component to deploy the rover and move the rover.
4) With sample data its being done.
5) Pending: Writing code to integrate front end app with back end api so that front end app will consume backend api service 
and display rover moving inside the grid.
6) To make front end more interesting, added few crators where rover shouldn't go etc.
